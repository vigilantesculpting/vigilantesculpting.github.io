<h3>how I've learned to (ab)use caulking silicone through trial and error</h3>
<p>This is a method I use for molding and casting small items that I make.
It is very similar to the typical DIY 1-part / 2-part mold making
process, but uses cheap caulking silicone for the mold instead of more
expensive RTV silicone.  </p>
<p>It is very similar to using brush-on silicone of various viscosities to
form a kind of jacket and outer mold. It is fairly quick; the example
mold I made for this howto took about two hours total. The mold needs to
rest for a bit after, but should be usable the next day.  </p>
<p>Materials required for the silicone:  </p>
<ul>
<li>caulking silicone: the 100% Type 1 stuff</li>
<li>white gas</li>
<li>dishwashing soap</li>
</ul>
<p>You'll need some other materials, these are common to most mold making.
Details below.  </p>
<p>The ten steps:  </p>
<ol>
<li>prepare the mold container: a box of lego and sulphur-free
    plasticine</li>
<li>lay out the pieces, the top has ALL the channel entry+exits.
    Minimise overhangs</li>
<li>cover it all with hairspray, the cheaper the better. Let it dry.</li>
<li>mix up thinned silicone, optionally tinted with a drop of white
    paint</li>
<li>cover all the mold parts with it. Use a stippling brush. Let it
    cure.</li>
<li>fill up the mold box with soap-and-water treated silicone. Let it
    cure.</li>
<li>flip the mold over in the box. Remove ALL plasticine.</li>
<li>repeat steps (3) through (6), inclusive.</li>
<li>remove the mold from the lego, pry apart, remove the master.</li>
<li>wash the mold in fresh warm soapy water. Let it dry!!!!</li>
</ol>
<p>In slightly more detail:  </p>
<h3>1) prepare the mold container: a box of lego &amp; plasticine</h3>
<p>This is similar to using RTV silicone, and the internet has a lot of
good info on this.<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFfXT_Cjpuk">This is the 8-part series of
videos</a> that got me
started. It's old, but gold.<br>
UPDATE: <a href="https://www.dakkadakka.com/dakkaforum/posts/list/242040.page">Here is a post on
dakkadakka</a>
that uses the same techniques, but uses Alumilite mold putty instead of
silicone. <a href="http://warfrog.blogspot.com/2011/11/two-part-mold-making-tutorial-resin.html">And here is another blog
post</a>
which does something very similar using Smoothcast silicone.  </p>
<p>The box will contain our mold, and should be deep and wide enough to
hold the item we want to mold, plus any channels through which the resin
should enter the mold, with space around the outside for the mold walls
to not get too thin.  </p>
<p>I use sulphur-free plasticine. Not sure that it is necessary for this
kind of silicone (it is required for RTV platinum silicone), but I
haven't experimented with anything else.  </p>
<p>Fill the box about halfway with plasticine.  </p>
<h3>2) lay out the pieces, the top has ALL the channel entry+exits. Minimise overhangs to prevent air pockets.</h3>
<p><img alt="" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OYNEmOjq9uo/W-26Z6OFzGI/AAAAAAAAADQ/0nV3W_RJrHsJbHTNkerAlTxhvb52J3nxACLcBGAs/s1600/IMG_5884.JPG" class="radiant-lightbox-slide" data-src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OYNEmOjq9uo/W-26Z6OFzGI/AAAAAAAAADQ/0nV3W_RJrHsJbHTNkerAlTxhvb52J3nxACLcBGAs/s1600/IMG_5884.JPG"></p>
<p>For this example I am using a plastic acorn that my kids were playing
with. First I embed the object in the plasticine, then I form channels
using bits of plastic from lollipops and cotton ear swabs that I cut to
size.  </p>
<p>There should be (at least) two channel entries at the top of the mold:
one for the resin to enter the mold (where I have the white piece of
plastic), and one (or more) for the resin to exit the mold. You want the
resin to flow into each shape from the bottom. You do not want the resin
to fill into a hole from which the air cannot escape.  </p>
<p>The parting line is important: pay attention to getting the plasticine
to form a 90-degree angle with the incident surface of the piece. The
cleaner this is, the better your mold and castings will be.  </p>
<p>Also add some key / registration marks: I use the end of a brush to push
little dots in the empty space between the container walls, channels and
the master. Don't make these too deep, we need to get the silicone in
there.  </p>
<h3>3) cover it all with hairspray, the cheaper the better. Let it dry.</h3>
<p>The hairspray acts as the silicone de-molding agent. Without it the
silicone will stick to your master, and you may end up destroying it (or
the mold!) when taking it out. You also don't want bits of it (paint
layers, etc) sticking around in the mold.  </p>
<p>Give it a good 2 or 3 sprays, and let it dry. We don't want the silicone
to rub it off, instead the silicone should stay on top of the hairspray
layer.  </p>
<p>I'm using the cheapest &amp; nastiest can of hairspray I could find at
Ralph's.  </p>
<h3>4) mix up thinned silicone, optionally tinted with a drop of acrylic paint</h3>
<p>The way I do this is by putting a squirt of silicone into a yoghurt
container or something similar, then adding a squirt of Coleman white
gas (anything containing
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naphtha">naphtha</a> should work) from an
eye-dropper, then stirring with a mixing stick. This thins the silicone
a bit. Don't overdo the naptha though. We don't want runny silicone,
just nicely spreadable.  </p>
<p>The optional paint (I use tungsten white) speeds up the curing process,
due to the moisture it contains. With the paint, my thin layer cures in
about 20 minutes. Without it the cure takes a bit longer, up to an hour.
It also makes the mold surface easier to inspect, since the pure
silicone caulk is transparent.  </p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-rPoMPc_vTkQ/W-27XtYixVI/AAAAAAAAADk/68dOSlV5J48umr4Jw-SiK8xvR5svZCTbACLcBGAs/s1600/IMG_5888.JPG" class="radiant-lightbox-slide" data-src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-rPoMPc_vTkQ/W-27XtYixVI/AAAAAAAAADk/68dOSlV5J48umr4Jw-SiK8xvR5svZCTbACLcBGAs/s1600/IMG_5888.JPG"></p>
<h3>5) cover all the mold parts with it. Use a stippling brush. Let it cure.</h3>
<p>Basically, brush the thinned silicone all over the master and the
channels. The thinned silicone gets into all the details of the model,
which is what we want. (You'll note I built the box up to its full
height now).  </p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-YK_qs5D7-a4/W-27VjsrxDI/AAAAAAAAADg/gJAqor2voRIFvqh_lxbDTuZTIeWxNaVCQCLcBGAs/s1600/IMG_5887.JPG" class="radiant-lightbox-slide" data-src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-YK_qs5D7-a4/W-27VjsrxDI/AAAAAAAAADg/gJAqor2voRIFvqh_lxbDTuZTIeWxNaVCQCLcBGAs/s1600/IMG_5887.JPG"></p>
<p>You'll know the silicone has cured when it is touch dry, and when you
can peel the remaining silicone from the mixing container easily.  </p>
<h3>6) fill up the mold box with soap-and-water treated silicone. Let it cure.</h3>
<p>Take another yoghurt container, fill it halfway with water and add a
good squirt or three of dishwashing liquid to it. Now squirt enough
silicone into it to fill half the mold. Work it with your hands for a
couple of minutes. Try to get the entire silicone surface exposed to the
soapy water.  </p>
<p>The soap will stop the silicone sticking to your hands. The silicone
will cure throughout, and fairly fast, around 20 minutes, from contact
with the water, which is why you should massage it in the water
properly. In other words, work well it in the water, up to a minute or
two. The longer you work it, the stiffer the silicone will become and
the shorter the cure time will be.  </p>
<p>Now take the silicone and work it into the mold box. I use a lego plate
to smooth the surface of the silicone, since I want the surface to b
flat, and the silicone won't run by itself.  </p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mOqnr_L0JvI/W-28D6_prAI/AAAAAAAAAD0/NM-ejoM7qe8lJm64f_T5wHn51ilPenhVwCLcBGAs/s1600/IMG_5889.JPG" class="radiant-lightbox-slide" data-src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mOqnr_L0JvI/W-28D6_prAI/AAAAAAAAAD0/NM-ejoM7qe8lJm64f_T5wHn51ilPenhVwCLcBGAs/s1600/IMG_5889.JPG"></p>
<h3>7) flip the mold over in the box. Remove ALL plasticine.</h3>
<p>Once cured, take the mold out, and remove all the plasticine. Try to not
disturb the master and channels that should now be embedded in the cured
silicone. If anything pops out, try to place it back in the same way it
was.  </p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-0lc8OuVFiqc/W-28N4KfgNI/AAAAAAAAAD4/PANXbBqNZeEfkRZciIis2M7n8cIp8MXmwCLcBGAs/s1600/IMG_5891.JPG" class="radiant-lightbox-slide" data-src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-0lc8OuVFiqc/W-28N4KfgNI/AAAAAAAAAD4/PANXbBqNZeEfkRZciIis2M7n8cIp8MXmwCLcBGAs/s1600/IMG_5891.JPG"></p>
<h3>8) repeat steps (3) through (6), inclusive.</h3>
<p>What It Says. <em>Remember the hairspray</em>. If you don't, the next layer of
fresh silicone will stick to the cured layer of silicone, and you will
end up with a nice single block of silicone and your master embedded
inside it. You don't want that.  </p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-H2TDxYCNIVg/W-28ZZY8xSI/AAAAAAAAAEE/mvZXfXJnhxQ9XGY9By00zay6jdr5IR7pgCLcBGAs/s1600/IMG_5892.JPG" class="radiant-lightbox-slide" data-src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-H2TDxYCNIVg/W-28ZZY8xSI/AAAAAAAAAEE/mvZXfXJnhxQ9XGY9By00zay6jdr5IR7pgCLcBGAs/s1600/IMG_5892.JPG"></p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-j47nDkMIzcg/W-28ZQd_-eI/AAAAAAAAAEA/SSlHvx7KhfszxX4kUZW17ilzaN1gtOygACLcBGAs/s1600/IMG_5893.JPG" class="radiant-lightbox-slide" data-src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-j47nDkMIzcg/W-28ZQd_-eI/AAAAAAAAAEA/SSlHvx7KhfszxX4kUZW17ilzaN1gtOygACLcBGAs/s1600/IMG_5893.JPG"></p>
<h3>9) remove the mold from the lego, pry apart, remove the master.</h3>
<p>The silicone will fight you, even with the hairspray. Be gentle, try to
find a corner that gives you an opening, and gently try to get it open.
Your master may stick to the silicone. Don't rip it out, again try to
find a forgiving corner and work from there, or your master may take
some damage.  </p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-tDp9RxsFgwg/W-28hyvhcMI/AAAAAAAAAEM/Kql9O5AqsqQwVrDAME00xXVT0hzkNF9CwCLcBGAs/s1600/IMG_5894.JPG" class="radiant-lightbox-slide" data-src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-tDp9RxsFgwg/W-28hyvhcMI/AAAAAAAAAEM/Kql9O5AqsqQwVrDAME00xXVT0hzkNF9CwCLcBGAs/s1600/IMG_5894.JPG"></p>
<p>PS: The blue tint in the corner is leftover pen ink from the white piece
of plastic that I used for a channel. Ignore it :)  </p>
<h3>10) wash the mold in fresh warm soapy water. Let it dry!!!!</h3>
<p>We need to get the hairspray off. And anything else. The naphtha has to
evaporate as much as possible too. Any resin we pour into the mold will
react with any contaminants left on the silicone and most likely not
cure properly. As in, become a sticky mess. You don't want that. You can
also wash the master, if you want to use it somewhere else.  </p>
<p>I leave the mold immersed in water overnight, to make sure it is
completely cured, and to leech out any of the above-mentioned chemicals.
Just make sure it is dry before you cast resin into it!  </p>
<p>What you have now is a typical 2-part silicone mold. To cast resin into
it, you can use the same technique as with RTV silicone molds. Again,
the internet has a lot of good info on this. Refer to that video series
I linked to in step (1).  </p>
<h2>An example cast</h2>
<p>This is an example cast I made using the mold above. I used a 2-part
45-minute pot-life / 12 hour initial cure / 3 day full cure epoxy resin
that I tinted with some sepia ink. This resin is not ideal, it made lots
of bubbles, and has a horrible cure time, and has ultra-low viscosity
(so it leaks everywhere). So not ideal.  </p>
<p>First up you can see the upright closed mold, with supporting structure
all taped up. I injected the resin using a 10ml syringe into the entry
hole, unitl the resin came out of the exit hole.  </p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-a0Eso7dGBTA/W-82aA4iUzI/AAAAAAAAAE0/4qZaiLOc7Jo4rK4aNvkKJHYrDCarRR5MACEwYBhgL/s1600/IMG_5897.JPG" class="radiant-lightbox-slide" data-src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-a0Eso7dGBTA/W-82aA4iUzI/AAAAAAAAAE0/4qZaiLOc7Jo4rK4aNvkKJHYrDCarRR5MACEwYBhgL/s1600/IMG_5897.JPG"></p>
<p>The next image is the finished piece still inside the mold. On the left
you can see the original.  </p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7Bf4nEVeK80/W-82lqUTbGI/AAAAAAAAAE4/hJWJqjfjzGY4Mhto2oAwTO1AtOl4DrPcwCLcBGAs/s1600/IMG_5899.JPG" class="radiant-lightbox-slide" data-src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7Bf4nEVeK80/W-82lqUTbGI/AAAAAAAAAE4/hJWJqjfjzGY4Mhto2oAwTO1AtOl4DrPcwCLcBGAs/s1600/IMG_5899.JPG"></p>
<p>You can see that the resin level sank while hardening, but luckily the
entire piece was still cast. All the detail is there, it looks pretty
good. There is very little flash. Also, since this is the first cast, it
will clean up the mold by taking any leftover clay with it.  </p></div></section>
