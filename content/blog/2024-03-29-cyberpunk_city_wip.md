title: Cyberpunk city WIP

---
As you can tell, we recently bought some stuff form IKEA, and of course I had to start building a cyberpunk diorama for my spinner from it :)

Still heavy WIP, but the main lines are there. I have to paint it and decorate it out a bit more. And obviously the spinner too.
