I picked up a [Propper Chopper](https://hotwheels.fandom.com/wiki/Propper_Chopper), seeing as it looked very similar to a certain helicopter I remember watching on a tv show as a kid.

Sure, it doesn't match perfectly, but with a hacksaw, some styrene and epoxy putty it shouldn't be too much of a stretch, should it?

Still not done, but getting there.
