title: Cow mover

Some work in progress shots of the cow mover on the War Rig. This was some interesting on-the-fly work, and is very satisfying. The cab is really starting to take on the look of the original.

I've also added the helix-like ribbing on the tank, and replaced the cab's wheels with cast ones. The fortifications on the tank have some guns (these are removeable).

The cab and tank are now connected via a swivel hitch.
