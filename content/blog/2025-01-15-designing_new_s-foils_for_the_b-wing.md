title: Designing new S-foils for the B-Wing

---
It's been a while, but I am still working on the Kenner B-Wing. I got a 3d printer recently, and I've been spending a lot of time getting to know the Blender-to-3d-print pipeline.

One of the first things I printed was these new s-foils for the B-Wing.

This is a massive project, not least of all because this is the first large project I designed for 3d printing!

I needed to replace the mechanical arms that connect the s-foils to the body. These can swivel by turning one of the engine exhausts, so the design has to fit the existing mechanics.

The wings have to be light but sturdy, and of course they need that Star Wars look.

I plan on adding some extra stuff in this build, so the wings have to be hollow so I can run wiring.

So all in all these wings are a test print, and not the final design.

And the new arms need to match the old arms.
This is how they come out of the printer...
