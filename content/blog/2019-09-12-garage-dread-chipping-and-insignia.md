title: 'Garage dread: chipping and insignia'
---
Slapped some chipping and insignia on the garage dread.  
  
Basically, the same process as the Raptor's chipping, but I went a step
further and added chipped insignia too. This was done by fully painting
the insignia, then etching out parts with the basecoat it was painted
on.

So far I have a raven on the right shoulder, close support designation
on the left, and an aquilla and skull on the shin guards. I love how the
raven and aquilla came out. The close support is cool. Not sure about
the skull, but I can still fix it up.

He is joined by a test marine, also chipped. I didn't chip the marine's
insignia, I want him to look fresher.
