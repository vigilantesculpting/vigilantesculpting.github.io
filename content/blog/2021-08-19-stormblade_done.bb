Finishing up the project, it has been a great ride!

Using the airbrush, I deepened the blue on the hull, and gave it 
a light gray drybrush. Then added the muzzle burn on the 
lasguns, gave everything another once over with black and brown oil paint, and finished
up with a satin varnish, then finally redusted with some pigment.
