title: Primed and gap-filled dready
---
A coat of gray primer showed up a fair amount of tiny bubbles on the
surface of the parts, again more so toward the parts that I cast
first.  
  
I believe a couple of things led to this: first I was a bit frantic in
mixing the resin, since I know I have very limited pot-life before the
resin starts setting. So I may have mixed a bit too hard, creating lots
of bubbles in the mix. Second, and maybe more importantly, I didn't have
a very precise scale, which meant I had to eyeball the quantities of the
two resin parts.  
  
Both of these are beginner's mistakes, so I won't be too hard on myself.
In future I just have to remember to (a) mix accurately and (b) stir
slowly.  
  
Not that this will completely eliminate the bubbles; for that I will
need a [pressure pot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHigOAugmcE). But
this is casting on-the-cheap, so maybe one day when my ship comes in.  
  
To fill the bubbles, I mixed up a bit of glue and gray paint, and then
carefully applied this as thin as I could over the model. Next up is
painting time.
