I'm sending off [Saint Toad](https://toadchapel.com/)'s [forest
base](https://toadchapel.com/2019/09/22/lichen-it-another-forest-vignette/).
I'm sad to see it go, but I'm very excited to see what the next artist
will create using it.  
  
Here is a last glance of the huntress, before I removed her from the
base and packaged it up for its journey:

She will get a new base, but currently I am in painting mode so
construction will have to wait :)
