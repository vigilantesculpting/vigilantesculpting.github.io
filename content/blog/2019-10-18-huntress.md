title: Huntress
---
[Saint Toad](https://toadchapel.com/) had recently been posting a couple
of beautiful bases on coolminiornot. [One especially caught my
eye](https://toadchapel.com/2019/09/22/lichen-it-another-forest-vignette/),
and after I mentioned how it just begs for a mini to be put on it, he
graciously sent it to me.  
  
I started sculpting a female huntress from mostly beesputty, ready to
release a shot from her bow.  
Starting to love the beesputty...
