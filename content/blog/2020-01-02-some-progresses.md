Happy 2020! Hope you will have a great new decade!  
  
Here are some progress shots of the Space Hulk duel diorama:  
  
This is an action shot after weathering the base and basecoating the two
opponents:

This is the weathered base:

I covered the basecoat in varnish, then added a layer of salt and
hairspray, then added a layered PVA + paint coat, after which I washed
off the salt and scratched the paint (made easier by the hairspary),
before adding more grime and rust.  
  
Here are some shots of the terminator's face and armor. This is still
WIP.
