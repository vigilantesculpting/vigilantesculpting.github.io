Some wip shots of the dreadnought diorama:

This is almost done and ready for priming. Lots of little pipes and
details, so it looks quite messy right now. I am hoping to pull some of
the details forward, and push others into the background using the
paintjob.  
  
At this point, almost the entire thing can still be pulled apart, so
that I can get access to the nooks and crannies to get my paintbrush in
:)
