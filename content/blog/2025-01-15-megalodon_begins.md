title: Megalodon begins!

My eldest got a [Lego Monster Jam Megalodon](https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/monster-jam-megalodon-42134) for their birthday a while back.

This thing is a mean looking machine. I love the teeth. As do my other kids... so when one of them also wanted one, I told them to hang on to their hats, because I'll make one for them for gaslands. What can I say, I am their dad. And we play gaslands.

I started with a [Punk Rod](https://hotwheels.fandom.com/wiki/Punk_Rod):

I think it has the right shapes, the front of the hood looks like a snarling shark mouth already.
