title: Sabre Strike!
---
And just because I can't stand having just one project going at a time, here is another one I started last weekend: a scratchbuilt Sabre Strike Tank.

I aim to finish this one as quick as I can, given my experience with building the Land Raider and the Fire Raptor, and with minimal modifications to the stock Patoroch template. Here are some photos of the build process:

I started with some heavy chipboard for the basic hull, then used index card for the wheel hubs (since there are many of them, they don't need so much individual strength). The tank treadmaster was built from the basic paper template using heavy chipboard & cotton swab plastic bits, and then cast in resin.
