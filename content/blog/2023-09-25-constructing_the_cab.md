title: Constructing the cab

---
After making the Fleetmaster part that I needed, and having cast a bunch of wheels, I started working on the cab in earnest.

I just have to say that the cab is one of the most awesome design jobs that I have ever seen. 
Here are some concept sketches from [Weta Workshop's](https://www.wetaworkshop.com/) [Artstation page](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/n1AyX):

Here is the final version from the big screen:

Taking the Fleetmaster from before, I cut out the windows and amputated the front half, then started adding it all together:

At this point, the silhouette is generally there. I still need to add the cow pusher, the hydraulic arms, the exhaust pipes, tanks and other greeblies.
