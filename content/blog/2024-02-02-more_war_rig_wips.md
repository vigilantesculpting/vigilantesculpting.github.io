title: More War Rig WIPs

---
I was looking through my photos and found these shots of the WIP War Rig.

Took these while adding the shards of metal welded to the wheel rims. Made out of cardstock, which is sturdy enough when soaked with PVA.

This is the little quadlet of skulls that I made into a mold. Used this for all the skulls on the rig:

Here is the final painted piece. After this I still had to add a ton of weathering to get to the final product!
