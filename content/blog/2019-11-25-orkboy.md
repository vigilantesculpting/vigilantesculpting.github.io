title: Orkboy

I picked up a White Dwarf sometime in 2004, and got this Orkboy along
with it. This model has been in my box ever since, and has travelled
with me from Germany to the USA via South Africa and Australia over the
last 15 years.  
  
I finally though now is the time to give it some love.  
  
How deep is you unpainted pile of shame?
