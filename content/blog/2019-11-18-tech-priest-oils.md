title: Tech priest oils

Slapping some paint on the tech priest: I am going for a more grimdark
style paintjob here. Starting with some metallics and dirty oils.

Also made a base for it, some small gears and bits ripped from a
printer, cork chunks, a couple of cast skulls and greenstuff pipes, and
coated in sandy glue and grime. I added a dirty wash and some oils.
