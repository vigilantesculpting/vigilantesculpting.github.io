title: Papermodelling principles
---
I was recently invited by [Saint
Toad](http://www.coolminiornot.com/forums/member.php?148377-SaintToad)
to write an article on my approach to papermodelling and crafting, for
his blog over at [Toad Chapel](https://toadchapel.com/).  
  
Saint Toad hosts some excellent tutorials by some very talented people,
so I am honored that he asked me to join in.  
  
[Go and have a
read](https://toadchapel.com/2019/07/02/papermodeling-principles/), let
me know what you think!
