First the main cannon: I removed the chunky blood raven and replaced it with a holy book of some sort (probably borrowed from a library somewhere):

Next I removed the previous chunky bloodraven + crown from the sidedoors, and posed it with the new sword + bloodraven + crown, which I think looks heaps better:

The winged skulls on the back also get replaced:

And here is the new aquila in situ. I'll replace the blobby skulls with some crisper ones too.

Here is a wip shot of the colorscheme for the side door stuff:

In that picture is also a cast from my other project, a hooded skull, which I think will look good on the front sides of the track housings.
