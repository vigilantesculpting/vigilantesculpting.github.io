The hand took the longest to properly mold. Because I am using caulking
silicone, I had to squish the hand into a block of the stuff, and then
cut 4 slits to extract the fingers, with a separate air vent cut into
the side wall for each finger.

So what are we going to do today, Brain?  
Same thing we did yesterday Pinky: more Dreadnoughts!
