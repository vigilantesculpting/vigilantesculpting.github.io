So I've started posting stuff on instagram, my handle there is
[gorb314](https://www.instagram.com/gorb314/).  
And at some point I thought it would be great to have a link back to
this blog, so that if someone was interested they could get back here
and read up a bit more.  
  
Life carried on, for a bit. Then all of a sudden instagram started
blocking my actions for some reason, and I finally figured out it was
because of that link...  
  
Facebook is being vague about why.<span class="_c24 _2iem"></span> Using
the facebook debugger only tells me that the link to this website <span
class="_c24 _2iem">can't reviewed "because the content doesn't meet our
Community Standards. If you think this is a mistake, please let us
know". They even give you a little dialog box, that probably goes
straight to /dev/null.</span>  
  
<span class="_c24 _2iem">So pray tell, Facebook. Which part of this
website does not meet your "Community Standards"?</span>  
  
<span class="_c24 _2iem"> <span class="_c24 _2iem">From a bit of
googling, it looks like most blogspot links are blocked by the Facebook
monopoly. Is this just Facebook being an a-hole to Google?</span>
