<h1>About</h1>
<p>
Hi, my name is Chris. I've been drawing from a young age, always as a hobby, and got into scratchbuilding and sculpting in 2018.
</p>
<p>
I love science fiction, and the world of miniature sculpting, building and painting is a really creative and inspiring space to be in.
A lot of my inspiration comes from wargaming, and early TV shows that I grew up watching, including Robotech, Star Trek and Buck Rogers influence me greatly.
</p>

<h1>About the content</h1>
<p>
On this site you'll find a bunch of my creations, including the miniatures that I've sculpted and painted, and sketches that I draw and paint.
A lot of it is traditional media, but I am doing more digital drawing as I go on.
</p>
<p>
Some of the posts will be marked <b>NSFW/Mature Content</b>. These will be clearly indicated and I won't post explicit parts of these sketches on the front pages.

<h1>About the site</h1>
<p>
This site is statically built from source, using a python script called bubble.py
It allows you to use pure python to generate structured HTML, using chains of calls and with-clauses so that the code and the HTML structure follows each other closely.
It runs pretty fast too, reading in my blog content and re-generating my entire site in 2 seconds on my MacBook Pro.

The static site is hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>, using a <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">Namecheap</a> domain.
