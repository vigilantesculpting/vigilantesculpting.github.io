This is a small diorama piece inspired by a painting by Kan Liu(666K信譞) on Artstation.

The [url=https://www.artstation.com/artwork/QrKxvr]painting is called "Tying hair and getting ready"[/url], and you can see more of [url=https://www.artstation.com/666kart]Kan Liu(666K信譞)'s work here[/url].

I aimed to convey the feeling of the heavy bike hovering, with the girl slightly leaning to keep her balance.
The diorama background is a first for me, with the foreground blending smoothly into the background, and prodiving an almost 3d effect behind the figure.

I decided to give the bike and cyborg parts of the girl a shiny chrome finish, as a homage to the chrome airbrush artwork of the 80's. [url=http://sorayama.jp/]Hajime Sorayama[/url] (NSFW) is also a big influence here.

Everything in the diorama is hand-made. The girl and bike is constructed with apoxie sculpt and greenstuff over an armature of wire and plastic bits, and the backdrop is made from chipboard, cork and foam.
The girl is 37mm tall to eye-line, and the entire diorma (including backdrop) is 175mm tall.
