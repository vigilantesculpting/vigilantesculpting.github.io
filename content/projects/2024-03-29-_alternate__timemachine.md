title: (Alternate) Timemachine

---
The finished (alternate) Timemachine, built from a Dimachinni Veloce, instead of a DeLorean.

It features the brass clock on the dashboard, powered time circuits and a glowing flux capacitor, as well as a hoverboard on the passenger seat.

The exterior has glowing flux bands, Mr Fushion, and the exhausts from the wheel jets, as well as landing lights.

This was a lot of fun, both to build and to paint. I have a short stand for it, so it can be used in Gaslands games too.
