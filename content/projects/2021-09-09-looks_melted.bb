"Somebody must have bagged one of Ripley's bad guys"

I love [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliens_(film)]Aliens[/url], and this is my tribute to [url=https://www.hrgiger.com/]H.R. Giger[/url], [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cameron]James Cameron[/url],
and the iconic cast, special effects crews and everyone that brought this movie to us.

The project start in August 2020, and I finished it in September 2021. Construction went fairly quickly, including the sculpted marine and xenomorph. But painting took a lot longer.
I had in my head a vision of the contrasts of warm/cool, light and dark that I wanted to show, but the colors I had on there just never came together until now. Very happy with the end result.

Enjoy!
