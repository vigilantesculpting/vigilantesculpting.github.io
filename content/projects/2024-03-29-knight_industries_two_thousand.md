<i>"A shadowy flight into the dangerous world of a man who does not exist"</i>

Here's my Pointiac <s>'82</s>'84 Fireboird-to-KITT conversion. I am very happy with it!

This was a very quick and fun project. The only thing bump in the road (pun intended) was the glossy finish on the black body. I had to strip and redo this a number of times before I got the smooth finish that I wanted.
