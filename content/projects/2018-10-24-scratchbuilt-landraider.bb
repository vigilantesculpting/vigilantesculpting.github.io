This was my very first scratchbuilt mixed-media model, which kicked off my journey in this scratchbuilding hobby.

I started from a paper template by Eli Patoroch, and experimented with plaster cast tracks from a silicon caulk mold, sculpey and greenstuff, and lots of paper card and cardboard.

It has since gotten [url='/projects/2020-12-08-land-raider-update.html']a make-over[/url], adding a space marine gunner and all sorts of other (finer) detail, as well as a better paintjob.
