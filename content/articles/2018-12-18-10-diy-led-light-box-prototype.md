title: $10 DIY LED light box prototype
---
Over at puttyandpaint.com there are some sculptors who produce pretty
amazing work. People like [Patrick "The Small"
Masson](https://www.puttyandpaint.com/TheSmall), [Gautier "Graphigaut"
Giroud](https://www.puttyandpaint.com/Graphigaut) and [Luc "Thantor"
Pinganaud](https://www.puttyandpaint.com/LuxThantor) in particular are
some of my favorites.  
  
The thing they all have in common (apart from all being from France?) is
that the photos of their finished work is great. Really good lighting,
everything in focus, and some of them use a background that really draws
the eyes to the mini.  
  
So I got me a [2m LED strip + power from
ebay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/1M-5M-Waterproof-LED-SMD-5050-5630-3528-Flexible-Strip-Light-with-Remote-Power/322894151781)
for $10, and taped some white paper into a cardboard box, temporarily
fixed a piece of the strip to the inside, then downloaded & printed out
[a nice background from Massive
Voodoo](http://massivevoodoo.blogspot.com/2010/05/photo-backgrounds.html)
and snapped a photo of Ms. Jet:

Not too bad. I used the neutral medium background, I might try something
like the neutral dark next time, maybe print it out with heavy toner,
but other than that I think it works.  
  
Here is a shot of the dodgy setup

and here it is in action.

Not bad for $10 and about 15 minutes of work.  
  
I'll be making a proper box soon, and securely install the LED strip.
I'm thinking of using a larger box, maybe with the option of putting an
extractor fan in the back so I can use it to airbrush too.
