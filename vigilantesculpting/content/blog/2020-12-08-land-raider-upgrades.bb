title: Land Raider upgrades
---
I'm calling the Land Raider rework project done. It has been fun, revisiting my first papercraft tank and adding some refinement to it.
In addition to the physical elements, I've added a lot of the weathering techniques I've picked up so far, so lots of chipping and oil streaking/staining, plus the barrel heat staining and the mud.
And the OSL on the headlights looks much better than before, even if it isn't perfect yet.

I will leave it here though, time to move on, and hopefully in a couple of years I'll be able to look back and see how much I've improved :)

Here are a metric bucketload of photos...
