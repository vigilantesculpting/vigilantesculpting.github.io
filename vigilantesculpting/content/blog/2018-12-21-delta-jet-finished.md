title: Delta Jet, finished!

I've finished my sculpt of Delta Jet. She's my third sculpt at 35mm.

Overall I'm happy. I think I've got her pose and general body shape just
right. She is obviously female, but not over-proportioned.  
  
The open hand could do with some work, but again this is my first
attempt, and I don't think it came out too bad. What I'm not very happy
with is her face and hair. These are very tricky though, so I just have
to practice more.
