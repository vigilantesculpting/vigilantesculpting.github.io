title: Ace Bolt, Strontium Dog?
---
I was browsing Pinterest the other day, and all of a sudden realised
where about 95% of my inspiration comes from: 2000AD. When I was 14
years old, a friend of mine brought this awesome hardcover magazine
thing to school, it was the 1985 Annual, a yearly publication, and I got
hooked on it straight away.  
  
For example, take my friend Ace Bolt here. Dress him up in some gaudy
looking green & yellow garb, with a bit of red on his visor, and I think
he could pass for a certain Strontium Dog's distant cousin.
