The pilot, made from a cast of the gunner mold, with the arms chopped
and re-glued, and pelvis structure added.

As before, there are a couple of bubbles in the cast - the pitfalls of
silicone / resin casting without a vacuum or pressure pot. These will be
cleaned up once I prime him and can tell where they are :)  
  
At this point the Fire Raptor is about 99.9% structurally finished. The
only part left really is the mount point for the flight stand. Once this
is done I'll prime the whole shebang, ready for painting.
