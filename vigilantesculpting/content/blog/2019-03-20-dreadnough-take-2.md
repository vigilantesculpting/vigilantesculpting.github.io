title: Dreadnought, take 2
---
The [previous dreadnought I
built](https://vigilantesculpting.blogspot.com/2018/10/test-post.html)
was pretty much straight up from the Drednoyt III Patoroch template, and
it worked out pretty well: I even made a garage mold from the parts and
[successfully did a cast
too](https://vigilantesculpting.blogspot.com/2018/12/dreadnought-proto-clone.html)
([primed model
here](https://vigilantesculpting.blogspot.com/2018/12/primed-and-gap-filled-dready.html)).
However I have a specific project for the master, and got back to
working on it recently.  
  
To my dismay I discovered that the master has lots of little bits of
silicone stuck to it, which is a pain to remove. I think it happened
because I didn't (a) coat the master properly with a varnish and (b)
didn't use enough mold release. Thus the surface of the master is quite
rough in places, allowing the silicone to stick to it and tear off the
mold. Keep in mind this is caulking silicone, thinned (ie. weakened)
with naptha, so it doesn't have a high tear strength.  
  
So having learned from my previous attempt I set out to rebuild the
dreadnought, starting with the main body. However this time I knew what
I was aiming for, so I pretty much started scratchbuilding right away.
I borrowed some bits from the template I had used before.  
  
The main thing I did different was to make the parting line between the
bottom and top half way more interesting, with a circular cut on the
sides, and indented cuts at the front and back. I also (at the last
minute) decided to use the mouth/teeth shapes of the dreadnought as a
kind of interlocking mechanism when the body is closed.  
  
This should make for an interesting look when the model is posed with
the "cockpit" open: the dready should look like a gaping jaw that is
about to swallow the pilot (or what's left of the pilot, dreads being
walking tombs for slain warriors).  
  
I'm pretty excited about this; I plan to scratchbuild the legs and
weapons as well, and only re-use the shoulders and waist from the
Patoroch template. If I get around to it I might publish the modified
template too.  
  
Enough talk, let's have some pictures:
