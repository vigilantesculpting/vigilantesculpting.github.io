title: Iron Jesters
---
This is a squad of Terminators that I bought a while ago on Ebay.

I've been wanting to do something with them, that isn't my usual Paint-em-red-and-call-em-Blood-Ravens. So I came up with a custom chapter, called the Iron Jesters.

Their chapter symbol is a stylised purple Fleur-de-Lis, converted into a Jester's hat.
