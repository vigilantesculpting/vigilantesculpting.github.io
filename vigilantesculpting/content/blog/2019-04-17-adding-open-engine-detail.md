title: Adding open engine detail
---
It's been a busy couple of weeks; family, work and tax season got in the
way.  
  
Finally started back up on the Raptor, adding some details to the
exposed engine parts on the top hull. In the Forgeworld model, there is
not much detail, just an exposed pipe, but I wanted something more like
the exposed engine pits on the Millennium Falcon, ie. exposed detail
that suggests more underneath.

Not sure that I pulled that kind of masterpiece off :) but I think it
looks pretty good so far. The piping is made from electrical wire, the
sleeves from either paper tubes or plastic tubing. Some card, some
paper, etc. for the fan intakes. It marries pretty well with the engine
detailing.  
  
Needs a bit more paneling on the back section. A detail view:
