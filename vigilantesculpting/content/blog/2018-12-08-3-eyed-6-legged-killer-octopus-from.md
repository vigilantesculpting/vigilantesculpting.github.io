Anyways, that's what my wife decided to call him.  
  
Here he is, done.

For this sculpt, I focused on getting the clay smooth (obviously in the
places I wanted it to be smooth, natch) and added some texture while
keeping everything clean. The only thing I'm not super happy with is the
eyes. Could have spent some more time there.  
  
He is about 35mm tall from lowest tentacles to the top of his cranium.
Made from a 24 gauge wire armature with green stuff, fimo and sculpey.
