title: Fire Raptor
---
I'm putting together a scratchbuilt [Fire Raptor
gunship](http://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Fire_Raptor_Gunship), based on
a template which I downloaded from
[papermodelers.com](http://www.papermodelers.com/). It is mostly
papercraft, but I plan using a bit of mixed media.  
  
It is an interesting build. I plan to make some modifications to it, the
first major one being that I want to model the interior of the craft,
with a hinged rear-entry ramp and the hinged hatch on top.  
  
I've started the build log at
[papermodelers.com](http://www.papermodelers.com/forum/alternate-dimensions/42866-fire-raptor-version-2-a.html).
