Slowly adding detail to Panzer Girl.

I've removed the visor part from the helmet; this will be cast in clear
resin, which should provide a bit more illumination for the girl's
face.  
  
Much happier with the upper rear of the model, but not so sure the skirt
around the bottom.

More work to do...
