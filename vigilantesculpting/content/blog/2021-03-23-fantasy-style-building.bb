title: 'Fantasy style building'
---
My daughter got very inspired after seeing some of Dented Armor's ([url]https://www.instagram.com/dentedarmor/[/url]) work on instagram, where he builds these fantastic
fantasy style buildings, so I spent some time on Sunday working with my kids to build a forest cottage for them.
Of course, they want to play with their Lego people inside the building, so I opted for leaving the back of the cottage exposed.
It is not yet complete: I still need to add some bricks around the chimney for example, but they are super amped about it and now want an entire city lol.

A quick sketch before we got started:
