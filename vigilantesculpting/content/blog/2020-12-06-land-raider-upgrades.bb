title: Land Raider upgrades
---
I spent some time on the Land Raider rework, adding a bit of weathering to the piece. Next up will be some oil staining/streaking & heat staining of the weapon barrels, 
then some dusty mud on the tracks, and finally the redo of the OSL on the headlamps.
Right now I gave the whole thing a coat of gloss varnish, so it is veeeery shiny :)
