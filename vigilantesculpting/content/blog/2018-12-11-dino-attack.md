So my 6yo daughter also wanted to play with clay. I asked her what she
wanted to make and she said a T-rex. I googled some reference pictures
for her, made her an armature with wire and foil, and then gave her a
ball of sculpey.  
  
I did give her a hand with the shape of the upper and lower jaws, and
showed her how to make the eyes, but the rest is her work.

The first piece of sculpey I gave her had some fimo mixed in, that's why
it is darker.
