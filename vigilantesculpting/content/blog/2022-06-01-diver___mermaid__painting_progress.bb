title: Diver & mermaid, painting progress

Some updated photos of the diver & mermaid diorama.
I had previously gone with a darker and dirtier greenish seawater look, and especially on the background, but decided to clean it all up.
The background is now a very simple blue gradient, and the diver is green in contrast with the orange/red of the mermaid.

I think the bubbles came out pretty well.
