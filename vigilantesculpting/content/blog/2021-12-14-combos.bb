I'm recovering from shoulder surgery on my dominant arm right now, so not much happening on the hobby front.
Still, I made some progress on the power armor bust prior to going under the knife.

Here are some shots of the bust, and bust + suit:

I re-added the helmet that I (almost) threw away.

I've also added a shoulder cannon that can be mounted to the suit:

The idea is that I will make molds out of the individual pieces, and I should be able to kitbash a couple
of different looks and feels from this one model.
