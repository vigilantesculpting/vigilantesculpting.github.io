title: Underwater encounter
---

This is a handmade mixed-media diorama. The figures are hand-sculpted in greenstuff and fimo, at around 75mm scale.
The mine is scratchbuild from fruit packaging, bits of plastic rod & card. The bubbles are cast in tinted water clear polyurethane resin, from a master built up from sculpey and desiccant spheres. The whole diorama (including the background) is about 30cm tall.

I've had this idea for an underwater diorama for some time now, and finally finished building and painting it all up.

Everything is about contrasts here, from the mermaid who can swim freely to the encumbered diver, to the exposure and covering of skin to the colors and textures, to the contrast between the feminine figures and the mechanical mine.

It is meant to be wall-mounted, but I have made a small stand for it too.
