A bit of rework of my [url=2018-10-24-scratchbuilt-landraider.html]original papercraft Land Raider[/url], my first project.

Here are some comparison photos, with the original on top and the new work below.

I added some extra detail, such as the space marine gunner, and gave it a much better looking paint job with some weathering techniques I picked up over the past years.

You may recognize some of the greeblie detail (including the gunner!) are casts from other projects.
